# Tic-Tac-Toe-sockets
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project is a simple, fun, and classic game of Tic Tac Toe with sockets, implemented in Python.

This project is a simple demonstration of using socket programming to create a networked Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other over a network, with one player hosting the game server and the other connecting as a client. This project is intended purely as a demo to show the basics of socket programming. For better experience, use the one with GUI.
